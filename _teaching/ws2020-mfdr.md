Description
======
The Internet and digital technologies are transforming societies, business and research. In our digital age, digital single markets remove barriers to access the goods and services, Industry 4.0 connects devices and platforms to enable flexible manufacturing processes, data driven science and big data analytics radically change research and innovation. All these promising advancements are only possible with the availability of the machine interpretable and processable data.

However, current methods to generate, store and exchange data are not sufficient to generate machine-interpretable data. Data reusability studies focus on methods, standards, infrastructures and tools to improve discoverability, semantic interoperability, traceability, and data exchange. Various large-scale infrastructures such as the European Open Science Cloud, ELIXIR, EUDAT, i2b2 or decentral architectures such as the International Data Spaces establish digital infrastructures and ecosystems to enable data sharing and consumption.

In this seminar, students will research on components and enabling technologies of digital data reuse infrastructures. Seminar topics will cover data models, standards, methods to improve discoverability, accessibility and semantic interpretability of data and metadata and to generate value out of data, as well as analysis of best practices and recommendations for data reuse.
